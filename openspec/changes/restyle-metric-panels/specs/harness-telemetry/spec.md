## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Scoped cumulative harness metrics
Hook adapters SHALL expose supported cumulative input/output and cached/uncached token counters independently of last-response usage, preserving their source timestamp and harness scope. Codex context percentage SHALL follow the verified installed harness calculation when its required inputs exist; Pi SHALL use its supported context API. Cache hits/misses SHALL be labelled as token quantities rather than request counts. Compaction totals SHALL be exported only with complete trustworthy coverage; truncated or incompatible sources SHALL remain unknown. Existing session identity, file bounds, numeric allowlisting, privacy and expiry checks SHALL apply to all added fields.

#### Scenario: Cumulative versus last-response usage
- **WHEN** a supported Codex record contains cumulative and last-response counters
- **THEN** both retain their scopes and the display can show cumulative totals rather than substituting the last response.

#### Scenario: Complete Pi session
- **WHEN** Pi supplies a supported complete bounded session entry collection
- **THEN** numeric assistant usage and compaction entries contribute to scoped session totals without exposing message content.

#### Scenario: Incomplete or invalid accounting
- **WHEN** bounded reads cannot establish full compaction or cumulative coverage, counters are malformed or usage is stale
- **THEN** affected totals remain unknown and a newer hook does not manufacture freshness or zeroes.
