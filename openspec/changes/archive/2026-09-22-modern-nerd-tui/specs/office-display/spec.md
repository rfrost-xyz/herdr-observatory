## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Modern glyph-capable terminal
The display SHALL provide a modern themed TUI with locally served Nerd Font glyphs, Unicode separators, clear thread-state labels and consistent typography in live and animated views. Icons SHALL supplement readable words. Font availability SHALL NOT prevent current state from rendering.

#### Scenario: Locally rendered glyphs
- **WHEN** a browser loads the display without installed Nerd Fonts
- **THEN** the bundled font renders state and section glyphs without external font requests, and whole-terminal effects use the same face.

#### Scenario: Font failure and accessibility
- **WHEN** the font cannot load or reduced motion is enabled
- **THEN** readable state labels, keyboard controls and the accessible current-state transcript remain available.

#### Scenario: Modern one-screen composition
- **WHEN** threads and events arrive at 720p or 1080p
- **THEN** themed glyph-led rows and Unicode separators retain clear thread state above the scrolling feed, within the existing padded viewport.
